I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://economics.ubc.ca) and a Ph.D. Fellow at the [Stone Centre on Wealth and Income Inequality at VSE](https://stonecentre.economics.ubc.ca). I have research interests in Labour Economics and Applied Econometrics. My work studies how labour regulations and public policy affect inequality in the labour market.

Before joining the Ph.D. program at UBC, I worked as an economist at Banco de México. I hold a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Instituto Politécnico Nacional and an M.A. in Economics from El Colegio de México.
