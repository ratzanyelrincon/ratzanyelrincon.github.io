I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of British Columbia (UBC), with research interests in Labour Economics and Applied Econometrics. In particular, I study how labour regulations and public policy affect inequality in the labour market.

Before joining the Ph.D. program at UBC, I worked as an economist at Banco de México. I hold a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from Instituto Politécnico Nacional and an M.A. in Economics from El Colegio de México.
